## System Requirements

- 16-core CPU
- 64 GB RAM
- Basically io1 or above with at least 20k+ iops and RAID-0 based disk structure

## Configuration

To setup the Archive Node, you need to follow the same process for deploying a full node [using binaries](/operate/full-node-binaries.md) or [using Ansible](/operate/full-node-deployment.md).

However, it requires a minor configuration change. You should include the following parameter in the `start.sh` file:

```makefile
--gcmode 'archive'
```
